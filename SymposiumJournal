5/4: (Start) Today's goal will be to figure out the more concrete details of our game.
(End) We looked into trying to install and Android Development IDE but found it to be impractical to install it at school because it would take forever. As such, we're going to download it at home and play around with it there. Tomorrow, we'll see how exactly we're going to use this IDE.

5/5: (Start) Since Kevin is absent (and since he's the only one with actual Android Development AND networking experience), we're kinda lost. Today we're just gonna keep working on the game's plot and features and reconvene with Kevin on Monday.
(End) I promise we're not actually totally dependent on Kevin. Since we're just getting started, we really need Kevin to show us the basics. Today, we just discussed the possibility of basing the game off of Miitomo. Over the weekend, we're gonna download this app and play around with it and see how we can adopt this game and spice it up with the LoveHunterX theme.

5/8: (Start) Over the weekend,I set up Android Studio on my laptop and connected the IDE to Github. Today our main goal will be to get Shoheb and Mike onboard.
(End) Kevin gave us some exercise to mess around with how graphics are drawn on the screen. We'll be doing some work at home for the next two days because of APs. We still need to get Shoheb's IDE working though, but Kevin will take care of that at home.

5/9: Out for AP Java

5/10: Out for AP Calc BC

5/11: (Start) Because of APs, our team hasn't been able to get much done in terms of code these past few days. Today, our goal will be to reconvene and discuss what Kevin/Mike did over the last two days. 
(End) We now have a basic roadmap of how these weeks are going to play out and what everyone's roles will be. We also did a few more exercises,
finishing up the ones we started on 5/8.

5/12: (Start) Today we starting off by discussing how we'll be implementing network functionalities into our game.
(End) We now have a more concrete understanding of the main game. Over the weekend, we're going to get a better understanding of how the networking stuff is going to work out.

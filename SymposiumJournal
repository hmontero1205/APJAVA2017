5/4: (Start) Today's goal will be to figure out the more concrete details of our game.
(End) We looked into trying to install and Android Development IDE but found it to be impractical to install it at school because it would take forever. As such, we're going to download it at home and play around with it there. Tomorrow, we'll see how exactly we're going to use this IDE.

5/5: (Start) Since Kevin is absent (and since he's the only one with actual Android Development AND networking experience), we're kinda lost. Today we're just gonna keep working on the game's plot and features and reconvene with Kevin on Monday.
(End) I promise we're not actually totally dependent on Kevin. Since we're just getting started, we really need Kevin to show us the basics. Today, we just discussed the possibility of basing the game off of Miitomo. Over the weekend, we're gonna download this app and play around with it and see how we can adopt this game and spice it up with the LoveHunterX theme.
